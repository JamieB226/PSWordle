PowerShell implementation of Wordle

This is a PowerShell version of the game Wordle (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).  There is no association with the original game.  The rules as I understand them have been re-implemented in PowerShell.  The puzzles are different than the daily ones on the Wordle site (in fact, you can play as many times a day as you wish).

The script can take a word file or download one from GitHub if one is not supplied.

All the game play and rules belong to the original creators of Wordle.  All the poor coding is mine.
